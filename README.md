# AskYourTB
This is an AI chatbot using Langchain and Pinecone to answer questions using the inputted textbook. Basically like a more advanced ctrl-f tool that answers your questions and cites it's sources!

# To Test: 
- Download the ipynb file to your computer and open it in Google Colab or your python IDE of choice.
- Make sure to update the path of your textbook
- Add in an OpenAI API key (unfortunately you donâ€™t get to use mine ðŸ˜…)
- Update queries at the bottom and watch your textbook come to life!

# Future Plans:
- Streamlit: I will use streamlit to transform the chatbot into a user friendly UI
- Page Numbers: I will augment the chat responses to include page numbers in regular language
- Memory: Using Langchain memory agents I will try to add memory to make the bot more useful in conversations
